  My name is Troy Riding, I am 32 and have two young children ages 3 and 5. Born on the sunshine coast and moved to North QLD now I live in North Brisbane. I am currently a dual-tradesman in Electrical/ Refrigeration and Air-conditioning on the tools. I do like physical labour, although my body is not able to tolerate it as much anymore. I enjoy listening to music around a fire with friends and family, also used to play a lot of computer games (until work picked up a lot).

<h1 style="color:blue;"><strong>About Me</strong></h1>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My name is Troy Riding, I am 32 and have two young children ages 3 and 5. Born on the sunshine coast and moved to North QLD now I live in North Brisbane. I am currently a dual-tradesman in Electrical/ Refrigeration and Air-conditioning on the tools. I do like physical labour, although my body is not able to tolerate it as much anymore. I enjoy listening to music around a fire with friends and family, also used to play a lot of computer games (until work picked up a lot).</p>
<h1 style="color:blue;"><strong>Interests in IT</strong></h1>
<p>My interests in Information Technology started from an early age playing a logic game on a dos computer. From there it blossomed into the first Nintendo console, Super Nintendo, Nintendo 64 then to the computer. I built my first computer when I was 12 years of age with my uncle. I have an interest in both software and hardware in the IT industry. I enjoy helping people when it comes to these sorts of things.</p>
<h1 style="color:blue;"><strong>Ideal Job</strong></h1>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My ideal job in the information technology industry at this point in time would be to become a cyber-security analyst. I believe a cyber-security analyst is someone who is always watching out for the protection of others online, whether it is for a particular small business to a large corporation. This position would potentially be able to keep confidentiality away from those who would use it for unlawful things.Develop, maintain and support to virtual intelligence capability to identify current and emerging cyber security risks.</p>
<p>Some of the skill required to be able to successfully maintain a career such as this one would be as per below - Develop, maintain and support to virtual intelligence capability to identify current and emerging cyber security risks.Monitor and Report to key stakeholders making sure that the risk and security policy requirements are met.This company requires previous experience in Microsoft Security Suite, Vulnerability management tools and SIEM platforms such as Splunk.I do not possess any of the required skills that this job is requiring, I believe one day in the future I would have obtained such skills to improve my success to be able to apply for such a position.</p>

<h1><strong>About Me</strong></h1>
<p>My name is Troy Riding, I am 32 and have two young children ages 3 and 5. Born on the sunshine coast and moved to North QLD now I live in North Brisbane. I am currently a dual-tradesman in Electrical/ Refrigeration and Air-conditioning on the tools. I do like physical labour, although my body is not able to tolerate it as much anymore. I enjoy listening to music around a fire with friends and family, also used to play a lot of computer games (until work picked up a lot).</p>
<h1><strong>Interests in IT</strong></h1>
<p>My interests in Information Technology started from an early age playing a logic game on a dos computer. From there it blossomed into the first Nintendo console, Super Nintendo, Nintendo 64 then to the computer. I built my first computer when I was 12 years of age with my uncle. I have an interest in both software and hardware in the IT industry. I enjoy helping people when it comes to these sorts of things.</p>
<h1><strong>Ideal Job</strong></h1>
<p>My ideal job in the information technology industry at this point in time would be to become a cyber-security analyst. I believe a cyber-security analyst is someone who is always watching out for the protection of others online, whether it is for a particular small business to a large corporation. This position would potentially be able to keep confidentiality away from those who would use it for unlawful things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Develop, maintain and support to virtual intelligence capability to identify current and emerging cyber security risks.</p>

<h1><strong>Personal Profile</strong></h1>
<p>These tests give other people an indication of the type of person that I am in a more factual understanding. They give me a better understanding of myself. The tests give a more detailed representation of the person that I might be.</p>
<p>These results can give an employer or fellow employees something to work with in terms of which team I would fit in to achieve the best results for both parties.</p>
